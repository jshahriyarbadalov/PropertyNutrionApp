        "Lasagna Style Spaghetti Squash",
        "1 spaghetti squash\n1 lb italian sausage or any choice of meat\n2 cups of your favorite pasta sauce\n2 tablespoons fresh basil\n½ cup ricotta cheese\n½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese (plus extra for topping)\nolive oil or coconut oil\nsalt & pepper\nroasting the squash\n",
        "1. Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees. Wash spaghetti squash, cut off stem and slice squash lengthwise. Scoop out the seeds and gunk. (save the seeds and roast them!) Brush with oil, season with salt and pepper, and place in baking dish (9×13 works well) with a little water in the bottom of the dish — as the squash cooks, you can add more water if it dries up. \n2. Roast for 45-60 minutes, depending on squash size, or until inside is soft and easily “fluffs” with a fork. It will look like very tiny spaghetti noodles.\n3. While squash is roasting, brown Italian sausage in large skillet over medium heat. Remove sausage from the pan drain and set aside. Add sauce to the pan and simmer. Add the sausage back into the sauce.\n4. In a bowl, combine the ricotta, mozzarella, and fresh basil, set aside. When squash is tender, remove from oven and using a fork, scoop, fluff, flake, scrape, whatever you’d like to call it, to get the inside of the squash to look like spaghetti noodles. You don’t have to get at ALL of the squash, you can scoop more later when you get to the bottom after it’s been filled and you’re enjoying it for dinner.\n5. Now we fill them! Start with a scoop of the red sauce, followed by a layer of the cheese mixture, (you can add extra mozzarella on each layer too!) and repeat the layers until you’ve over filled your squash, ending with a layer of red sauce and then topping them with mozzarella. 6. Totally over fill these suckers. Turn the oven to broil and put them back in to brown up the cheesy top.\n"

        "1. In a large bowl, cream the butter, cream cheese and Stevia with an electric mixer. Add the eggs, one or two at a time; blend in the vanilla. The batter will look curdled. Mix the almond flour, coconut flour and baking powder; add to the egg mixture a little at a time. Beat about 1 minute until fluffy. Spread the batter in a greased 9x13\" glass cake pan. Bake at 350º for 30 minutes. The cake will be golden brown and firm to the touch when done. Cool the cake on a wire rack.\n2. While the cake is cooling, prepare the gelatin according to the package directions. Chill until the outside edges are just starting to set up but the center is still liquid. This will take a little over an hour. Poke the entire surface of the cake every 1/2 inch with a skewer or large meat fork. Slowly and evenly pour the liquid gelatin over the cake. Chill 2-3 hours. Frost with the Whipped Topping.\n3. Do not use commercial coconut flour in this recipe. It won't work because it will make the cake very dry.\n4. Whipped Topping. Beat all of the ingredients until thick and fluffy. \n"
